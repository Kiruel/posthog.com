It is up to you when to involve our product designers in your work.

The factors to consider are:

## v0.1 or v2?

As the feature owner, you should make a choice if you're building a very basic first iteration of something, or if you're improving the experience.

If you're improving an existing feature that is popular, you are probably creating v2.

If you're shipping an entirely new feature (ie SQL for PostHog), then you should be figuring out if anyone cares, which usually means creating a v0.1, and releasing it behind a feature flag to some friendly users (pro tip - make friends by being support hero).

## T-shirt sizes

The more complex a feature to implement, the more likely it is that involving product design will make you faster.

## Your design skill

We generally hire full stack engineers, but some people think more like designers than others. This is fine - you should play to your strengths.

The less strong you are at design, the more we'd encourage you to involve a product designer.

If you're unsure about your skill level, ask a product designer for direct feedback. [This is a book we'd recommend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things) if you want to learn the mindset.
