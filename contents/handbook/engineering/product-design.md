It is up to you when to involve our product designers in your work.

## v0.1 or v2?

As the feature owner, you should make a choice if you're building a very basic first iteration of something, or if you're improving the experience.

If you're improving an existing feature that is popular, you are probably creating v2.

If you're shipping an entirely new feature (ie SQL for PostHog), then you should be figuring out if anyone cares, which usually means creating a v0.1, and releasing it behind a feature flag to some friendly users (pro tip - make friends by being support hero).

Please _communicate_ what your expectation is to product design too here!

### T-shirt sizes

The more complex a feature to implement, the more likely it is that involving product design will make you faster.

### Your design skill

We generally hire full stack engineers, but some people think more like designers than others. This is fine - you should play to your strengths.

The less strong you are at design, the more we'd encourage you to involve a product designer.

If you're unsure about your skill level, ask a product designer for direct feedback. [This is a book we'd recommend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things) if you want to learn the mindset.

### If product design has capacity

Sometimes product design may push back if they simply haven't got capacity. It's subjective when this may happen, and it'll usually be in cases where they feel they won't be as helpful based on the above.
